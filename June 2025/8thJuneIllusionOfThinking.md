# Illusion of Thinking: Understanding Strengths and Limitations of LRMs

Date: 8th June 2025

## Key Points
- Uses puzzles with tunable complexify rather than maths problems (these suffer from data contamination).
- Observations at different complexities:
    1. Low: non-reasoning > reasoning (more direct circuits).
    2. Medium: non-reasoning < reasoning
    3. High: both fail! Interesting, the reasoning models stop producing more tokens over a threshold of complexity.
