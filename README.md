# PaperDiary
I have been keeping up to date with deep learning but trying to read at least one paper a day.

I recently decided to keep track of this using this repository!

## Interesting Methods
This section outlines in a sentence or two some of the most interesting methods and common themes.

1. LLM reasoning self-play, rooted to reality by a coding engine (Absolute Zero Reasoner).
The dynamic was for the LLM to both design coding problems as well as solve them.
Interesting to see how this coupd be applied in other domains, with different environments rooting them to reality (e.g. robotics)
